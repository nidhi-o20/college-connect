# College Connect

## PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
College Connect is a complete career guide which helps students to
get into desired colleges which are best for them. If they are confused
about which branch they should choose they can opt for a short real
world based aptitude test and the system will recommend the best fit
branch for them. If the student is sure about the branch , he/she can
directly use our college recommendation system and get the list of
best fit colleges for the desired branches based on their percentile. If a
student is already a college student and is worried about which book
to refer to, he/she can go through a short quiz which will evaluate
his/her level of understanding of that subject and will recommend the
book on the basis of the score and pace of learning.

This application was created as a Mini Project in Python for Semester-4 IT of MU.

#### To run the system use: python crs_user.py

## Modules:
College Connect is a desktop application which is used for
recommending colleges and books to students. The key concept is to
help students throughout their engineering career, not only to get
admission into desired colleges which are best for them but also by
recommending them books for their curriculum, on the basis of their
preferred pace of learning.<br> 

This system consists of a home page
where user can proceed with one of the two choices : 
    ####1.#### College recommendation for recommending desired colleges based
    on userâ€™s percentile. If the users are unsure they can attempt an
    aptitude test to learn which branch is best suitable for them or if they
    are sure about the branch, they can directly proceed with college
    recommendation.
    ####2.#### Other features consist of a book recommendation option which
    recommends books to the user on the basis of the user's pace of
    learning and level of understanding.

#### Features
1. The aptitude test has questions based on real world scenarios to understand which branch the user is interested in, after giving the test, results of the test are displayed according to the user's response, in the form of a pie chart showing the distribution of branches which gives them a clear understanding of which branch is best suited according to their interest.
2. The college recommendation system has all the branches from which a user can select one or more branches for which he wishes to obtain the college list based on his percentile.
3. When a user hits the submit button, the system will display the college list which he can opt for. If a user selects multiple branches, the system will provide multiple lists of each branch according to his percentile.
4. User can get location based recommendation of colleges by selecting the cities and branches he is intrested in.
5. User can provide e-mail address to recieve these files on his email address.
